There are many great README templates available on GitHub; however, I didn't find one that really suited my needs so I created this enhanced one. I want to create a README template so amazing that it'll be the last one you ever need -- I think this is it.

#### Why this course rocks ?

Let me ask you a few questions:

- Do you want to learn to build responsive websites that look 100% professional?
- Do you want to be confident that your website works well on all devices?
- Are you tired of feeling that your CSS is a mess?

If your answer is YES, then this is the perfect course for you!
It gives you a deep understanding of CSS and responsive design while keeping you fully engaged along the way. You'll learn to build four different layouts: a blog, a landing page, a banner, and a company website. Each one will take your skills to a new level.
